Question :  Perform sorting of an array in descending order.

Firstly, Let's Expand the Question in detail for better understanding :   
Imagine you have a bag of different-sized toys: a big toy, a medium-sized one, a smaller one, and so on. Now, this Question is like organizing those toys from the biggest to the tiniest. 
So, if your toys were numbers, like [5, 2, 9, 1, 3, 6], we should sort them like "The biggest toy is 9, then 5, then 4, and so on, down to the smallest one, which is 1.

Now, Let's Understand the coding part :

function sortDescending(arr) {  --> This line defines a function called sortDescending that takes an array of numbers as input [Ex:5, 2, 9, 1, 3, 6]

return arr.sort((a, b) => b - a); --> Inside the function, there's a special way of comparing numbers: (a, b) => b - a. This way tells the computer how to decide which number is bigger when sorting.

const numbers = [5, 2, 9, 1, 3, 6]; --> Here, a list of numbers [5, 2, 9, 1, 3, 6] is created. Imagine these numbers as toys as we discussed in the question, all jumbled up and not in any order.

const descendingSorted = sortDescending(numbers); -->This line uses the sortDescending function to sort the list of numbers. applies the special sorting method defined in sortDescending, and organizes them from biggest to smallest.
The sorted numbers are now [9, 5, 6, 3, 2, 1].

console.log(descendingSorted);:

Finally, console.log is a command that shows something on the screen.
It displays the sorted numbers [9, 5, 6, 3, 2, 1] on the screen.
